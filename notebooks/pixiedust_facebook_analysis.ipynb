    "# Analyze Facebook Data Using IBM Watson and IBM Watson Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a three-part notebook written in `Python_3.5` meant to show how anyone can enrich and analyze a combined dataset of unstructured and structured information with IBM Watson and IBM Watson Studio. For this example we are using a standard Facebook Analytics export which features texts from posts, articles and thumbnails, along with standard performance metrics such as likes, shares, and impressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part I** will use the Natual Language Understanding, Visual Recognition and Tone Analyzer Services from IBM Watson to enrich the Facebook Posts, Thumbnails, and Articles by pulling out `Emotion Tones`, `Social Tones`, `Language Tones`, `Entities`, `Keywords`, and `Document Sentiment`. The end result of Part I will be additional features and metrics we can test, analyze, and visualize in Part III. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part II** will be used to set up the visualizations and tests we will run in Part III. The end result of Part II will be multiple pandas DataFrames that will contain the values, and metrics needed to find insights from the Part III tests and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part III** will include services from IBM's Watson Studio, including IBM's own data visualization library PixieDust. In Part III we will run analysis on the data from the Facebook Analytics export, such as the number of likes, comments, shares, to the overall reach for each post, and will compare it to the enriched data we pulled in Part I.\n",

I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. \n",
      "More paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. \n",
      "Wells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. \n",
      "My property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. \n",
      "They can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. \n",

      "I applied for a loan with XXXX XXXX and had purchased XXXX vehicle during the month of XXXX 2014. I was told that I would be getting a good deal on the vehicles in which i purchased. I later found out that the interest rate charged for the loans at the time was almost XXXX times that of the average consumer for the credit score that I had and when I came back to speak to the finance manager. The dealership had let her go for fudging many of the loans and jacking up many customers interest in order to make a higher commission and she was no longer employed with the company due to her increasing many loans on the interest that some of their consumers were paying. The dealership as of today 's date has never contacted me and had i not inquired I would have never known the truth. When I applied my credit score was showing XXXX approximately and thought that I would get the lowest interest rate at the dealership offered but instead I received an interest rate that was nearly XXXX of that of the regular consumer. I am requesting an investigation on the lending of loans and services of this company based on the following Discrimination based on race, and color, gender for I was charged a higher rate than other consumers of a different race, gender or color I request an immediate investigation on the loans that were processed during the time that I applied and it will show this to be a everyday factor practice based on race and to investigate the transactions of this company and how they are advertising a certain price and then selling their vehicles for more than the advertised price. It is like a bait and switch on the consumer. Predatory lending has clearly been an everyday factor in order for the finance department to make a better commissions on the consumer who is not aware of how the process works. I was charged a higher rate for no reason other than greed. Fair and accurate transaction was not taken into account by dealership. Equal credit opportunity act has been was not taken into account. Gramm leach biley act was not taken into account. After purchasing the vehicle I was called back into the office to sign more paperwork again after the vehicle was in my possession for more than a month. I was told that it was necessary in order to get my military discount. I never got the discount on my vehicles and the price of the vehicles was sold for more than they advertised which I later found out from the XXXX ledger. I am still trying to figure out where is the discount and why was I charged a higher interest rate and why did the finance manager deliberately fudge my loan. consumers of a different race who have purchased from this dealership have lower interest rates than mine with lower credit scores than what I had when I purchased my vehicle. As of today 's date their is no discount, higher interest rate, higher price paid for vehicles and the military rate was applied later and went somewhere else for all I know. It is truly a shock to me to see a dealership do this to a consumer. \n",

      "Mel S. Harris & assoc. used deceptive collection practices while attempting to collect on a purchased debt. Once initial contact had been made and a discussion on solutions to resolve the debt, the attorney office sent out a summons for an appearance in court. The representative had advised us that \" we should not worry because we will receive several of these notifications. '' However, there was a case filed in the city court and required an immediate response to avoid a default judgment. This summons was used as a collection tool while in mutual good faith discussion on how to repay the debt. The representatives refused to discuss reasonable payment arrangements and told us to deal with the courts. When I inquired as to why a summons was sent out while we were talking to their agency in good faith I was hung up on. After calling back XXXX times I was finally connected to a supervisor who again tried to tell me not to worry about the summons. As I inquired further as to the reason of the summons I was hung up on again. I was hung up on a total of XXXX times while asking to speak to a manager or an attorney within their office. This debt is over XXXX years old and was supposedly incurred by my mother in law who is on a fixed income and under the care of XXXX. Every time I had requested documentation or verification of the debt I was told to deal with it in court -- even though I was assured prior, that nothing had been sent or filed with the court! I am an advocate for my mother in law while dealing with what I consider to be an unprofessional and unscrupulous debt collector. The summons was sent just to solidify their subtle threats of garnishment, liens, or any other means at their disposal. My concern is that this would appear to be a regular occurrence with this agency. Once the attorney office makes contact with a consumer they issue a summons to scare the debtor. My mother in law was served on XXXX/XXXX/15 ; we had started discussing the debt on XXXX/XXXX/15 which means they ordered it while we were discussing in good faith our options on the debt. Mel S. Harris & assoc is using the power and intimidation of the summons and the court system as a scare tactic and collection tool to coerce and discriminate against consumers \n",

We specifically waited until after XXXX to close and had a closing date of XXXX. It was discovered through the escrow office as I read the documents that the credit amount was still in the debit column rather than the credit. I immediately called B of A. I made multiple attempts to correct it as quickly as possible with B of A. My case manager XXXX XXXX was always responsive and helpful.

The initial disclosure provided to me indicated a promotional rate of 0.00 APR on purchases ( 6 months ) and balance transfers ( for 15 months ). Upon receiving my card the disclosure provided did not reference the promotional rate on the balance transfers, therefore I called the company to discuss and was told the promotional was only on purchases. Therefore, I submitted a complaint through the bank 's website on XXXX/XXXX/15. After several back and forth responses and a letter received, it was still being indicated the promotional rate is only on purchases. As already expressed this is not what was initially disclosed to me and therefore this is deceptive to me as a consumer as I made a credit decision based on the initially information provided to me that appear to be false.

The judge just this year ordered the note to go back to the mtg company, and closed the case. I have since then remarried, and have worked very hard rebuilding my credit. Even though I am not responsible for this debt anylonger due to the bankruptcy, I still can not qualify for a loan until 7 years past a foreclosed date!!!

I have written nurmerous letters to the bank as well as one to the XXXX of Florida, and have been directed to you for assistance. I have seen homes foreclose within a year or so, and mine has been over 7!!! Can you please help??

      "Wells Fargo Mortgage began foreclosure action due to non-payment that we had set up auto pay option on. Did not receive notification that auto payment option was cancelled nor did we receive information regarding foreclosure action until we attempted to make a purchase. We contacted them and asked if they could waive late fees and reinstatement fees since we were not notified. After speaking with them at length, they indicated after conducting their research they felt they were not at fault and denied any waiver of either fees. They felt that regardless of any previous discussion that they had sent written notification to us that there were no payments set up automatically, and that we should have contacted them once we received that. After advising them we did n't receive the letter they stated that we should have been monitoring our account and making sure the payments were being made and we would have known that way. Throughout a month 's worth of phone calls with multiple employees of Wells Fargo beginning on XXXX/XXXX/15, I was provided misinformation almost every time I called in. Some examples include the individuals each time had to be explained the entire story and they would explain what their records reflected on the account and none of the information was what was actually discussed. They had indicated we had never requested reinstatement letter, then that it would be mailed when we had asked for a fax ; they stated we had not received it because they were busy and to check back, and once we did they stated a second reinstatement letter had been requested ; after following up again we were told they had begun a loan modification process which was never requested ; when asking for a supervisor the call was conveniently disconnected ; each time we called the same number we received a different staff member sometimes in a different state ; every call they were asked if we could go into an office and speak with someone and were told there was none local ; after multiple requests for information sent in some other form than a fax we were told they do n't use email only XXXX. After XXXX Wells Fargo and calling a different number we were told XXXX person had been assigned to our case. This was not until XXXX/XXXX/15. After finally receiving a call from this person after leaving messages, we were told the request to waive fees would be denied and a letter would be sent XXXX, we have still not received it. We were told if the fees were not paid by XXXX that there would be additional fees incurred and they were still pursuing the foreclosure. We ended up paying the fees to get the home out of foreclosure and received a verbal answer that this has been done. When asking for written confirmation, we were advised we would receive this via email which was interesting because up until this time this was not possible. We still do n't have this letter. They had said they do not use electronic communication for security purposes. We were also advised we would receive a written account of their research and determination not to waive fees which would be sent overnight mail but have not received this either. When asked if our credit had been updated to reflect that we were current, we were told they would take care of this only after our next month mortgage payment was made which is not due until the beginning of the month. The money for our mortgage payments was being payroll deducted into a Wells Fargo checking account and was sitting there rather than being taken out for the mortgage. We do n't even bank with them normally and only opened the account for the mortgage payments. We received XXXX random letters via XXXX about attempts to contact us and update our acct. as though they are trying to cover their backs on previous attempts never made. These letters were received no problem, but those requested and promised have not as of XXXX/XXXX/15. \n",

The insurance was again in the event I was unable to pay my bill they would pay it. Although Bank of America no longer does business with this company. The insurance company refunded the consumers some of the money and it was either sent as a check. Bank of America takes my money and than says there is not payment it is a credit.

      "I live in California, my former mortgage holder, XXXX, went bankrupt and sold our loan to Green Tree. Prior to the sell, I had never heard of this company. As a result of the sell Green Tree opened an escrow account, to pay property taxes and insurance, I never had a escrow account before and do not believe the State of California requires lenders to maintain an escrow account. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30+ year mortgage and the monthly mortgage payment is {$1200.00} and I pay $ XXXX monthly to cover the escrow payment for property taxes and insurance. According to my monthly statement from Green Tree, my regular monthly payment is {$1500.00} so I pay roughly {$11.00} per month more than is required which I acknowledge was no designated to be applied to the escrow account until I recently made my XXXX payment. Despite my attempts to comply with the terms of this loan, every year since Green Tree has held our mortgage we get a bill for XXXX of dollars, this year it was {$800.00}, supposedly because of escrow shortages. Every year it 's a different amount, but the escrow shortages are always for XXXX of dollars and the amount of insurance and property taxes we pay annually does not increase that much to justify these increases of XXXX of dollars each year. Green Tree provides this annual escrow account disclosure statement with this convoluted calculation to justify these increases ( copy attached ). This year XXXX days prior to receiving the annual escrow account disclosure statement we received a letter from Green Tree stating that our account was current ( copy attached ). Each year I contact Green Tree to get someone to explain these calculations and I have yet to understand the justification or the explanation. If you do n't pay the amount of the shortage Green Tree threatens to increase the amount of your regular monthly payment to cover the shortage. I find it hard to believe it is legal for a mortgage company to charge a borrower XXXX of dollars more per year to maintain an escrow account if it 's cheaper for the borrower to pay their own property taxes and insurance. If the borrower 's property taxes and insurance are not delinquent, then a borrower should be able to opt out of such a onerous escrow arrangement. If Green Tree is able to charge people XXXX of dollars more each year for these \" supposed escrow shortages '' it 's no wonder they require borrowers to have an escrow account. We should be able to pay our own property taxes and insurance to avoid the financial hardship that Green Tree is creating. We are currently stuck with this mortgage company, but at the first opportunity we will make every effort to change lenders. But I do n't believe we should be penalized because we are stuck with this company. A company we did not voluntarily enter into a contract with. It should not be legal for a mortgage company to require consumers to have an escrow account that costs them hundreds of dollars more per year than it would cost if that consumer paid their own property taxes and insurance. I do n't know if this practice is legal but it should n't be and it definitely needs to be investigated. \n",

      "This complaint is because we have attempted to have our mortgage payment modified numerous times since I suffered an injury at work which in turn greatly reduced our income. Since that happened we have tried to have Bank of America work with us to keep our home and payments manageable and they have done nothing to assist us in applying for a modification. However, over the past 3 years our requests have been ignored, paperwork reportedly never received, our phone calls were not returned and our phone numbers were changed in their computer system to an unknown number. Below will outline the issues as they have occurred. It is crucial that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene as they play to auction our home on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. In XXXX I took a loan from my XXXX to catch up with payments. Later that year I closed my XXXX fund to attempt to prevent foreclosure. At this time we informed them we would not be able to maintain the regular payments and requested a modification. XXXX XXXX, was assigned actually provided us with a list of necessary documents and they were faxed to him in the beginning of XXXX XXXX from a Bank of America branch location in XXXX, XXXX on XXXX XXXX, by a customer service representative named XXXX XXXX The original copies of the documents sent are available if needed. On XXXX XXXX, we were informed, that we were automatically removed from the modification program. Clarification was not provided. However, Bank of America knew that we planned to returned our account to good standing XXXX my XXXX 's XXXX XXXX was settled at on XXXX. In XXXX we paid {$17000.00} to Bank of America in attempt to keep our home. From that point communication stalled with Bank of America although we informed them we could not pay the current mortgage payment at over {$1800.00} per month. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a payment was made in the amount of {$5600.00} to Bank of America from a check withdrawn from XXXX XXXX XXXX bank, check XXXX. Knowing that this would be the XXXX time we would be receiving any bulk money and at this time we would start receiving regular income as I had been approved for Social Security XXXX, we again requested to apply for a modification while on the phone making the payment. We were told we would be contacted by a new assigned account manager. No one contacted us. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I contacted Bank of America again to start a modification process, I spoke with XXXX. I expressed my concern with Bank XXXX XXXX inability to willingly assist us in seeking a modification. She assured me this time would be different and to call her with issues. On XXXX XXXX, we received in the mail the paperwork from XXXX, and it states that it is due back XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from Bank of America representative and I immediately requested that they call me back in 15 minutes because I was trying to get my children out and I did not want to discuss this matter in front of them. I recall emphasizing please call me back, I did not even ask for the persons information. I did not receive a call back. About 3 hours later I called back the number on my caller ID, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and there was a message that there was a high call volume due to weather. Realizing I did not even know who I was calling I hung up and waited for them to contact me again. On XXXX XXXX, I still had no contact from BOA and attempted to call XXXX back, I was redirected to the account manager, XXXX. I asked about the call on XXXX XXXX and she stated that she thought I was calling her back. I stated, you did not provide me with a name or number, how was I suppose to locate you? She informed me that my house is scheduled to be auctioned on XXXX XXXX. In the past year we have been assigned XXXX account managers, none have ever called our home, except XXXX a week ago. \n",
